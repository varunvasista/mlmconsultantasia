          We specialise in many of the multilevel marketing compensation plan and the most widely used plan is the BINARY MLM Plan which allows distributors to have only two front-line distributors. If a distributor sponsors more than two distributors, the excess are placed at levels below the sponsoring distributors front-line. This &apos;Spillover Binary Plan&apos; is one of the most attractive features to new distributors since they need only sponsor two distributors to participate in the compensation plan. The primary limitation is that distributors must &apos;balance&apos; their two down line legs to receive commissions. Balancing legs typically requires that the number of sales from one down line leg constitute no more than a specified percentage of the distributor&apos;s total sales

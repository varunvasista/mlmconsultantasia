        <span className="text-slate-600 text-md mt-10">Electronic commerce or e-commerce is a term for any type of business, or commercial transaction, that involves the transfer of information across the Internet. It covers a range of different types of businesses, from consumer-based retail sites, through auction or music sites, to business exchanges trading goods and services between corporations. It is currently one of the most important aspects of the Internet to emerge.</span>
        <span className="text-slate-600 text-md mt-10">E-commerce allows consumers to electronically exchange goods and services with no barriers of time or distance. Electronic commerce has expanded rapidly over the past five years and is predicted to continue at this rate, or even accelerate. In the near future, the boundaries between conventional and electronic commerce will become increasingly blurred as more and more businesses move sections of their operations onto the Internet.</span>
